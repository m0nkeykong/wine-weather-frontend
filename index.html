						<h2>Who is the biggest wine manufacturer?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The wine world is not only small pictorial vineyards with a horse pulling a plow between the vines.<br>
					There is a handful of very large wine producers in the world, who together represent a quite big proportion of world wine production.<br>
					It is not always obvious who they are since they sell their wines under a variety of different brands and rarely under their own name.</p>

						<h2>Alchol and Pricing</h2>
					</header>
					<p>It's not accurate to say across the board that less expensive wines have a lower alcohol content than expensive ones.<br>
					  The wine process is basically the same no matter what the price point, but the biggest factor in determining alcohol content is the ripeness of the grapes.</p>

					<h2>Climate and Wine</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Wine grapes grow from Mexico to British Columbia. <br>
				The wide range in climates that grapes can grow results in different tasting wines.<br>
				For this reason, wine regions are grouped into two major climate types: Warm Climate vs. Cool Climate. <br>
				If you understand the general characteristics of both climate types, you can explore new wines from the climate type you prefer.</p>

					<h1>Conclusions</h1>
					<h2>Cold Weather Growings</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The colder the climate, the more difficult it is for the grape to be ripe - which means a more sour taste, lower sugar level, which leads to dry wines and lower levels of alcohol.
				<br>The ripeness of the grapes is directly affected by the amount of the sun on which the grape is exposed to and not necessarily to the temperature it is grown in. 
				<br>This is why prolonged rain can be a problem in areas where wine is grown. 
				<br>Another thing is that the more water the grapevine collects, the moisture the grape will get - leading to raw and diluted material</p>

				<header>
					<h1>Conclusions</h1>
					<h2>Warm Weather Growings</h2>
				</header>
				<p>As the climate is warmer, the grapes are riper - which results in less sourness, higher sugar levels, and darker color.
				<br>The higher the sugar levels, the higher the level of alcohol.
				<br>Note that the sugar levels in the grape are not related to the sugar levels found in wine after production.
				<br>Of course, there is the ability to turn sweet wine into a dry wine, but this will lead to an increase in alcohol levels.
				<br>A point to think about - even a very dry wine with a large amount of alcohol is still felt as slightly sweet.
				<br>For some reason, our body detects high alcohol levels as sweetness in the wine.</p>
